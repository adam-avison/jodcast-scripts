# jodcast-scripts
An attempt to turn the mystical Jodcast scripts from Perl to Python


SO FAR THIS JUST MAKES WEBPAGES... SOMEONE NEEDS TO WRITE THE AUDIO BITS!

- jodcastxml.py turns XML into HTML (check the directory structure in the scripts), there are redundant 
- jodcastxml_helper.py contains functions used by jodcastxml.py
- template3.html is an empty HTML doc which is required to make new HTML from the XML
- newshownotes.xml a template file which can be filled in each time
